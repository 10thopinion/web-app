# Symptom Checklist User Guide

## Overview
The Tenth Opinion Protocol now includes a comprehensive symptom checklist that makes it easier for patients to accurately report their symptoms. This replaces the need for a complex decision tree with a more efficient, medical-standard approach.

## How It Works

### 1. Symptom Checklist Section
When you open the patient form, you'll see the **Symptom Checklist** as the first major section. This includes:

- **14 Body Systems** organized by medical categories
- **110+ Common Symptoms** carefully selected for comprehensive coverage
- **Search Bar** to quickly find specific symptoms
- **Two View Modes**:
  - **By System**: Symptoms grouped by body system (default)
  - **All**: All symptoms in a flat list

### 2. Selecting Symptoms

#### By System View:
1. Click on any body system card (e.g., "Cardiovascular", "Respiratory")
2. The card expands to show all symptoms for that system
3. Check the boxes next to any symptoms you're experiencing
4. Selected systems show a badge with the count of selected symptoms

#### Search Function:
1. Type any symptom in the search bar
2. The list automatically filters to show matching symptoms
3. Select from the filtered results

### 3. Selected Symptoms Summary
As you select symptoms, they appear in a summary card at the bottom showing:
- All selected symptoms as removable badges
- Total count of selected symptoms
- Easy removal with the 'X' button on each badge

### 4. Additional Symptoms
Below the checklist, there's still an "Additional Symptoms" field where you can:
- Add symptoms not listed in the checklist
- Provide more specific descriptions
- Include symptom variations

### 5. Comprehensive Description
The detailed description field remains **required** to provide context about:
- When symptoms started
- Severity and patterns
- What makes them better or worse
- Impact on daily activities

## Benefits for Users

1. **Nothing Forgotten**: The checklist prompts you to consider symptoms you might not think to mention
2. **Faster Input**: Click symptoms instead of typing everything
3. **Better Organization**: Symptoms are grouped logically by body system
4. **More Accurate**: Uses medical terminology the AI agents understand
5. **Still Flexible**: Can add custom symptoms not in the list

## Benefits for AI Analysis

The 10 specialized AI agents receive:
- **Structured Data**: Symptoms organized by body system
- **Consistent Terminology**: Reduces ambiguity
- **Complete Picture**: All body systems considered
- **Pattern Recognition**: Easier to identify symptom clusters
- **Better Diagnoses**: More accurate differential diagnosis

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Thorough**: Check all symptoms you're experiencing, even mild ones
2. **Use Search**: If you can't find a symptom, try searching with different words
3. **Add Details**: Use the description field to explain severity and timing
4. **Include Everything**: Don't self-filter - let the AI agents determine relevance
5. **Review Before Submit**: Check the summary to ensure all symptoms are included

## Privacy & Security
